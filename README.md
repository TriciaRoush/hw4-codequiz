# hw4-codequiz
As a coding bootcamp student, the undertaking of this assignment is to create a quiz inspired by frontend coding trivia.  The user is faced with multiple choice answers to the questions as they race the timer for a high score, which will be stored until the user resets the local storage.  This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface and is dynamic and responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
